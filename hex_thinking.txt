you have this hex system
coord1
coord2
coord3

stored are coord1
and coord2

coord1 + coord2 + coord3 = 0

how do you get a hexagon?

coord1 from -hexsize to hexsize
coord2 from -hexsize to hexsize

does this give you all points in the hex?

the answer is YES
but it gives TOO MANY!

   /\
  /  \
 /    \
 \    /
  \  /
   \/

you want

   /-\
  /   \
  \   /
   \-/


too much hexagon per hexagon!
